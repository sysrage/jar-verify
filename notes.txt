 - is ko_version.txt required in linux driver packages?

 - validate subversion based on previously released build & md5sums

 - fix use of Path in all scripts
 - add debug logging
 - find cross-platform solution for extracting self-extracting zip files

 - add list of all expected files to config.pkgTypes?
 - validate xClarity workaround device IDs in linux firmware update scripts

=====================================

Linux Driver Packages:
  - Verify FixID format
  - Verify driver version
  - Verify FixID subversion
  - Verify all 5 files exist and are non-empty
  - Verify XML matches BOM
  - Verify tgz file can be extracted successfully

Windows Driver Packages:

Firmware Packages:

=========================================

 - Find out SVN location for config files, so I can check in BOM updates myself
 - Find out if Node.js can be installed on build server
