 x open bug to remove 'LPe1205a' and 'LPe1205-CIOv' from fwmatrix.txt in all Saturn firmware packages

 - is ko_version.txt required in linux driver packages?
 - add list of expected files to config.pkgTypes?

=====================================

bom-parse <BOM file>                        = parse BOM XLS and store as JSON
jar-verify -r <release> -b <build number>   = verify JARs
jar-verify -s                               = save last run data as an official release

Config File (separate sections for each release where applicable):
 - Linux distributions
 - Linux point releases
 - Linux kernel versions
 - Windows versions
 - VMware versions

Data Files:
 - store last released build number
 - store last released version/subversion for each component (only list packages that have changed)
 - JSON representation of BOM file

Linux Driver Packages:
  - Verify FixID format
  - Verify driver version
  - Verify FixID subversion
  - Verify all 5 files exist and are non-empty
  - Verify XML matches BOM
  - Verify tgz file can be extracted successfully

Windows Driver Packages:

Firmware Packages:

=========================================

Problems Found w/ Existing Packages:
 - All BE3, Lancer, and Skyhawk package driverFiles classifications should be '13' not 'firmware'
 - Invalid x32 Windows driverFile entry needs to be removed from Windows FCoE driver package
 - Duplicate Windows driverFile entry needs to be removed from Windows NIC driver package
 - Duplicate Agentless entries need to be removed from Saturn FW packages
 - Duplicate Agentless entries need to be removed from Lancer FW packages
 - The OS "VMware vSphere 2013" needs to be added to all VMware firmware packages

 - Old BOM contained 00JY829 instead of 00JY827 for Gold Lite. Ensure this is fixed in new packages.

=========================================

base15a.cfg:

 - What exactly does 'architectures' indicate? Each OS has different architecture support, so how is this general variable used?
 - What is the difference between the 'linux' and 'linux_os' variables and how is each one used?
 - What is the significance of the commented out 'linux_drivers' variable as opposed to the uncommented one? Does the order matter?
 - How are the 'name' variables used in each firmware section? Are they only used for the fwmatrix.txt file? They seem to be wrong for Saturn.

 - Are the '[DRIVER SUBVERSIONS]' and '[LNX_DRIVER]' sections ever changed or are they always set to '1'?
 - When are subversions for the firmware sections changed?
 - subversions should really be completely removed from base.cfg
 - mtms15a.cfg should be completely eliminated - list of machine types can be included directly in base.cfg
